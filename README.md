Introduction:
The URL Shortener App is a web application designed to shorten long URLs into more manageable and shareable links. Built using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, this app provides users with a simple and intuitive interface to generate short URLs for their long links.

Key Features:

    Shortening URLs: Users can input long URLs into the app's interface, and the app will generate a unique, shortened URL for them. This shortened URL can then be easily copied and shared.

    Redirection: When users access a shortened URL generated by the app, they are redirected to the original long URL associated with it. This seamless redirection ensures a smooth user experience.

    Customization: While the app automatically generates short URLs for users, it also allows for customization. Users can choose to create custom short URLs, enabling them to personalize their links for branding or tracking purposes.

    Analytics: The URL Shortener App provides users with basic analytics features. Users can view statistics such as the number of clicks on each shortened URL, helping them track the performance and reach of their links.

    API Integration: The app offers API integration, allowing developers to programmatically interact with its shortening and redirection functionalities. This enables seamless integration with other applications and services.

Technical Implementation:

    Flask Framework: The app is built using Flask, a micro web framework for Python. Flask provides the foundation for handling HTTP requests, routing, and rendering HTML templates.

    SQLite Database: The app utilizes SQLite, a lightweight relational database, for storing URL pairs (original URL and corresponding short URL). This simple database solution ensures efficient data storage and retrieval.

    Random Shortening Algorithm: Short URLs are generated using a combination of random characters, ensuring uniqueness and minimizing the likelihood of collisions. This algorithm creates short, memorable links for users.

    HTML/CSS Templates: The app includes HTML/CSS templates for the user interface, providing a visually appealing and responsive design. Templates are rendered dynamically based on user interactions and data from the database.
